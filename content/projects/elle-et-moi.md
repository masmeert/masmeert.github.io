elle-et-moi is an inventory management software built for the eponymous clothes store. Some of the interesting features implemented: QR code scanning, product trend reporting, low stock notifications, profit and loss reporting.

This app was made for one of my client and is therefore private, but if you want to have a peek at it feel free to contact me!
